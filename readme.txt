Encrypt all your messages send with Contact Form 7 using GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 GPG is a plugin for the well known Contact Form 7. It lets you encrypt all messages send with Contact Form 7 on your website using the [GPG port from Jason Hinkle](https://github.com/jasonhinkle/php-gpg). Because of the GPG / PGP port written in pure PHP, [Contact Form 7 GPG](http://pugstaller.com/contact-form-7-gpg/) doesn't need any additional extensions or packages (like the gnupg PECL package) to be installed on your server.

**Requirements: Contact Form 7 (version 3.9 or higher)**
